category	"Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}"	entity|category type

For example, the qualifier ‘mutation’ combines with the core concept ‘Gene X’ to express the compose concept ‘a mutation of Gene X’.	
aspect qualifier	Composes with the core concept to describe new concepts of a different ontological type. e.g. a process in which the core concept participates, a function/activity/role held by the core concept, or a characteristic/quality that inheres in the core concept.  The purpose of the aspect slot is to indicate what aspect is being affected in an  'affects' association.

qualified predicate	Predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers are present and the full reading of the statement requires a qualification to the predicate in use in order to refine or  increase the specificity of the full statement reading.  This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of that  expressed by the primary predicate, in a ‘full statement’ reading of the association, where qualifier-based  semantics are included.  This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in a  full statement reading.

related to	A relationship that is asserted between two named things	named thing|named thing
related to at concept level	Represents a relationship held between terminology components that describe the conceptual model of a domain.	
related to at instance level	Represents a relationship held between two instances of a data classes.  Much like an assertion component, in an ABox, these represent facts associated with the conceptual model.	
associated with	Expresses a relationship between two named things where the relationship is typically generated statistically (though not in all cases), and is weaker than its child, 'correlated with', but stronger than its parent, 'related to'. This relationship holds between two concepts represented by variables for which a statistical  dependence is demonstrated.  E.g. the statement “Atrial Fibrillation (Afib) is associated with Myocardial  Infraction (MI)” asserts that having Afib is not statistically independent from whether a patient  will also have MI. Note that in Translator associations, the subject and object concepts may map exactly to  the statistical variables, or represent related entities for which the variables serve as proxies in an  Association (e.g. diseases, chemical entities or processes).	named thing|named thing

close match	a list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have a semantically similar but not strictly equivalent, broader, or narrower meaning. Such terms often describe the same general concept from different ontological perspectives (e.g. drug as a type of chemical entity versus drug as a type of role borne by a chemical entity).	
exact match	holds between two entities that have strictly equivalent meanings, with a high degree of confidence	
broad match	a list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have a broader, more general meaning. Broader terms are typically shown as parents in a hierarchy or tree.

associated with likelihood of	A a relationship that holds between two concepts represented by variables for which a statistical  dependence is demonstrated, wherein the state or value of one variable predicts the future state  or value of the other.  E.g. the statement “An Atrial Fibrillation (Afib) diagnosis is associated  with likelihood of a Myocardial Infraction (MI) diagnosis” asserts that the state of having Afib  is associated with an increased or decreased likelihood that a patient will later exhibit MI.

entity to phenotypic feature association mixin		
information content entity to named thing association	association between a named thing and a information content entity where the specific context of the relationship between that named thing and the publication is unknown. For example, model organisms databases often capture the knowledge that a gene is found in a journal article, but not specifically the context in which that gene was documented in the article. In these cases, this association with the accompanying predicate 'mentions' could be used. Conversely, for more specific associations (like 'gene to disease association', the publication should be captured as an edge property).
