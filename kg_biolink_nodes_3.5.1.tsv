category	"Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}"	entity|category type

qualified predicate	Predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers are present and the full reading of the statement requires a qualification to the predicate in use in order to refine or  increase the specificity of the full statement reading.  This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of that  expressed by the primary predicate, in a ‘full statement’ reading of the association, where qualifier-based  semantics are included.  This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in a  full statement reading.

related to	A relationship that is asserted between two named things	named thing|named thing
related to at concept level	Represents a relationship held between terminology components that describe the conceptual model of a domain.	
related to at instance level	Represents a relationship held between two instances of a data classes.  Much like an assertion component, in an ABox, these represent facts associated with the conceptual model.	
associated with	Expresses a relationship between two named things where the relationship is typically generated statistically (though not in all cases), and is weaker than its child, 'correlated with', but stronger than its parent, 'related to'. This relationship holds between two concepts represented by variables for which a statistical  dependence is demonstrated.  E.g. the statement “Atrial Fibrillation (Afib) is associated with Myocardial  Infraction (MI)” asserts that having Afib is not statistically independent from whether a patient  will also have MI. Note that in Translator associations, the subject and object concepts may map exactly to  the statistical variables, or represent related entities for which the variables serve as proxies in an  Association (e.g. diseases, chemical entities or processes).	named thing|named thing

broad match	a list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have a broader, more general meaning. Broader terms are typically shown as parents in a hierarchy or tree.

associated with likelihood of	A a relationship that holds between two concepts represented by variables for which a statistical  dependence is demonstrated, wherein the state or value of one variable predicts the future state  or value of the other.  E.g. the statement “An Atrial Fibrillation (Afib) diagnosis is associated  with likelihood of a Myocardial Infraction (MI) diagnosis” asserts that the state of having Afib  is associated with an increased or decreased likelihood that a patient will later exhibit MI.
